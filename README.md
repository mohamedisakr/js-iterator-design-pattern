## Plan

### Check JavaScript Iterators and generators

### Try to implement the five main categories of iterators depending on the functionality they implement present in C++ Standard Library

1. Bidirectional iterators
2. Input iterators
3. Output iterator
4. Forward iterator
5. Random–access iterator

## Requirements

1. Asynchronous Iterators
2. peek() add peek function to iterator like hasNext() has the ability to “peek” at the next item without consuming it (more on this in a moment)
